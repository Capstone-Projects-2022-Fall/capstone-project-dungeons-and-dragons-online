# Dungeons and Dragons Online
## Overview
Dungeons and Dragons Online brings the popular tabletop game to the computer and the computer is the dungeon master. It is a two-dimensional, top down, multiplayer video game made with the Unity game engine. The focus of the game is on the combat between the players and the enemies they encounter. Each player will control their own character and as a team they will have to work together to make it through a dungeon by defeating enemies and avoiding traps. Once the final boss is defeated the players win. Each player will have a class they can choose that will give them special attributes and will determine how they will deal damage to enemies. The classes will be a warrior that attacks with a sword, an archer that can attack enemies from afar with their bow, and a mage that can use their healing abilities to heal other players. Dungeons will have the option to be procedurally generated so the layout, traps and enemies are always different. The game also has a player versus player combat arena, where users can battle it out to become the last one standing.
